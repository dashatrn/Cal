# Cal

A smart web app that turns screenshots and PDFs of meeting invites into real-time calendar updates — using either Cal’s own calendar engine or syncing with your Google Calendar.

## What Cal does (MVP)

- Upload an image or PDF of a meeting, class schedule, invite, syllabus, etc.
- Cal reads it and extracts the date, time, title, and location.
- You can fill in any missing details — like setting it as a background or blocked event, adjusting the title, or correcting the times.
- If there's a scheduling conflict, Cal will:
  - Suggest the next closest free time slot, or
  - Let you modify existing events.
- Save to your personal calendar, either:
  - into Cal’s own calendar engine (stored in your account), or
  - directly to your Google Calendar (if you connect it).
